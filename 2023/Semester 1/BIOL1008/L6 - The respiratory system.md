Trace the flow of air into the body beginning at the nose and ending at the alveoli 

![[Organs of the respiratory system.png]]

Organs of the Respiratory System, and order
?
1. Starts in nasal cavity 
2.  Pharynx 
3.  Larynx 
4.  Oesophagus (food pipe, glottis separates wind pipe)
5. Trachea wind pipe. Cartilage rings around the trachea
6. Right bronchus and left bronchus allow gas exchange in lungs

- Diaphragm band of skeletal muscle 

Lung part name
?
- Right side: superior, middle inferior lobe
- Left side: superior, inferior, cardiac notch 

1. The bronchus 
2. bronchiole 
3. alveoli

Alveoli (primary gas exchange organ where the tissue exchange gases)

Structure and function of Bronchioles 
?
composed of smooth muscle = alter diameter, to mediate constriction and dilation for air flow. Cartilage fades as you branch out. air -> alveoli 

What causes asthma and medication that's given to mediate symptoms
?
- constricted bronchioles 
- Broncho dilators, smooths muscle

Lungs are speckled because of all the little gas sacks.

The veins and capillary are very close together> in sacks> to allow for a greater and more efficient gas exchange.

### Explain partial pressure of gas and the components of air

#### Gas exchange:
- AKA respiration
- Uptake of O2 from the atmosphere and discharge of CO2 back into the environment
- A particular gas within a mixture of gases exerts a Pressure:
- So for a particular gas we can calculate its Partial pressure in that particular atmosphere.
- Gas pressure: mm in mercury.
- Knowing the partial pressure of a gas allows us to predict its movement
- Gases always diffuse from a region of high partial pressure to a low partial pressure.
 -Atmosphere: 21% oxygen, 0.03% CO2

Describe why expansion of the thoracic cavity also expands the lungs.

Why do our lungs expand when out chest contracts
?
- A double membrane surrounds the lungs
- One side adheres to the outside of the lung, the other to the wall of the thoracic cavity (ribs) (attached by the fluid between them)
- Filled with fluid that creates surface tension
- Easily stuck, but not easily pulled apart
- So every time our lungs move, the double membrane is pulled with it

Explain why breathing in (inspiration) is an active process compared to breathing out (expiration)
?
- Breathing out - Expiration
- Compared to inspiration, normal expiration usually does not require the contraction of any muscles
- Passive process
- Relaxation of diaphragm and rib cage reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity driving air OUT of the lungs

#### Gas exchange in the alveoli:
![[Alveolar gas exchange.png]]

Asthmatic :: Air that doesn't reach the alveoli; caught in "dead space" (no gas exchange)  Alveolar ventilation is reduced

Adequate perfusion of the alveoli is :: when the incoming blood supply matches the amount of air exchanged in the alveoli 

- Distance between capillaries and alveoli = very small = effective gas diffusion
- Alvelar space is very small and creates reapid gas exchange 
- Oxygen level is lower in alveoli because some of the air is stuck in dead space = lower pressure in alveoli

#### Gas transport in the blood:
- Oxygen is predominantly transported around the body bound to haemoglobin within red blood cells
- 98% transported this way 
- Remaining 2% dissolved in the plasma
- Carbon dioxide is transported by 3 different mechanisms
	- 7% dissolved in plasma
	- Remaining 93% within red blood cells, but via two separate mechanisms
		- 23% bound to haemoglobin
		- 70% converted to bicarbonate (transported to lungs and converted to co2 out the body)
