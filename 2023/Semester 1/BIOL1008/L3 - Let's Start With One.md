Explain how a single cell can survive and function in isolation.

Distinguish the main structure and function of a cell and its main organelles.
#biol1008question

| Organelle                   | Function |
| ---------------------------- | -------- |
| Nucleus function             |    Directs cell's life processes, contains the chromosome, contains one or more nucleoli.      |
| Nuclear membrane             |Separate the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Controls the highly-selective two-way exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm.          |
| Nucleolus                    | Ribosomal RNA is synthesised and combined with proteins.         |
| Cytoplasm                    | Semi-fluid material in which the organelles are found         |
| Cell membrane                | Regulates movement of substances into and out of the cell.         |
| Mitochondrion                |  Cellular respiration        |
| Rough endoplasmic reticulum |  Site of protein synthesis and transport.        |
| Smooth endoplasmic reticulum | Site of lipid synthesis.         |
| Golgi body                   | Storage, modification and packaging of secretory products.         |
| Lysosome                     |Contains hydrolytic enzymes; cellular digestion.          |
| Ribosome                             | Protein synthesis         |

Nucleus function :: Directs cell's life processes, contains the chromosome, contains one or more nucleoli.

Nuclear membrane :: Separate the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Controls the highly-selective two-way exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

Nucleolus :: Ribosomal RNA is synthesised and combined with proteins.

Cytoplasm :: Semi-fluid material in which the organelles are found

Cell membrane (plasma membrane) :: Regulates movement of substances into and out of the cell.

Mitochondrion :: Cellular respiration

Rough endoplasmic reticulum :: Site of protein synthesis and transport.

Smooth endoplasmic reticulum :: Site of lipid synthesis.

Golgi body :: Storage, modification and packaging of secretory products.

Lysosomes :: Contains hydrolytic enzymes; cellular digestion.

Ribosome :: Protein synthesis


Explain How cell membrane create compartmentalization which regulate the flow of substance into and out of cells? #biol1008question

### Cytoskeleton: 
It forms a framework for movement of organelles around the cytoplasm  - most of the organelles are attached to the **cytoskeleton**. The network consists of protein microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. The **cytoskeleton** provides an important structural framework for: Cell shape.

### Phospholipid bilayer: 
![[Phospholipid bilayer.png]]

Lipid bilayers are impermeable to most essential :: molecules and ions

Lipid bilayer are permeable to :: water molecules and a few other small, uncharged molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide 

Lipid bilayer are not permeable to :: ions such as K+, Na+, Ca2+, Cl-, HCO3-

What molecule state is glucose :: hydrophilic 

Examples of macromolecules are :: proteins and RNA

Describe the passive diffusion of water across semi permeable cell membrane and the role of aquaporins
#biol1008question

### Movement of molecules
Diffusion :: with time - due to random motion molecules become equally distributed i.e. to eliminate concentration gradients

### Water also diffuses
- The more solute (i.e. sugar or salt in a given volume) the higher the concentration of salt and lower amount of water 
- Water will always flow to where its concentration is lower
- Bulk flow of water concentration (osmosis) 
- Water wants to be at equilibrium (same number of molecules in each compartment)
- plasma membrane is semipermeable

### Tonicity - osmotic pressure: 
![[Tonicity.png]]

Isotonic :: any external solution that has the same solute concentration and water concentration compared to body fluids

Hypotonic :: any external solution that has a low solute concentration and high water concentration compared to body fluids

Hypertonic :: any external solution that has a high solute concentration and low water concentration compared to body fluids

Explain how large molecules and particles get in and out of cells 
#biol1008question 

### How to molecules get into the cell? 
- Cell membrane contains transmembrane proteins / integral membrane proteins
- Some of these form pores through the membrane 
Two board categories: 

Channels - facilitated diffusion 
Transporters - facilitated diffusion or active transport 

![[Endocytosis - Exocytosis.png]]

### How do membranes allow so much water through cells? 

### Aquaporin water channels.

![[Aquaporin water channels.png]]

Describe how the cell uses the Na-K ATPase to create the electrochemical gradient that provides the energy for life
#biol1008question 
- ion channels conduct charge. So if you move ions from one place to another, you can create a electrochemical potential difference.
![[Active transport. Sodium-Potassium pump.png]]

### Consequence of Na-K ATPase action
Opposite movement of  key ions
- Unequal movement of charge
-  3+ out and only 2+ in

### All cells have negative membrane 

### Potential
This is the electrochemical driving force!!!
