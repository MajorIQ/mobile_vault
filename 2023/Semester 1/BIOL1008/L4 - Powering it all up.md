Outline the major uses of energy in human
#biol1008question 

A key energy  source for cells :: Glucose

### Fats and fatty acids - The other key energy source
The key sources of energy for your cells
?
- Glucose and fatty acids are important when you are not
- Starving
- Most tissues use glucose
- Brain only uses glucose
- Heart muscle only uses fatty acids
- Skeletal muscle uses both

![[Brain lacks glucose.png]]
When you are starving, your cells can use
?
- Ketone bodies
- Glucose made by the liver from ammino acids (proteins and lactate)

### Ketone bodies
- Are produced in liver from  Acetyl Coenzyme A during starvation
- They are acetone and small organic acids
- They can be used by other tissues, including brain, to produce energy
- In people with uncontrolled diabetes they can reach very high levels, causing diabetic ketoacidosis

### Indirect calorimetry
indirect calorimetry relationships
?
- Measures O2 usage and/or CO2 production
- Requires that we know the relationship between O2 usage and/or Co2 production with energy usage.

### Direct calorimetry
- The process of measuring the rate in which an animal produces heat.
Lavoisier experiment 
?
How long does it take the Guinea pigs take to melt the ice?
- One calorie is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of water by 1 C
- The scientific unit of energy is the Joule (4.2 Joules per calorie)

Distinguish between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism as mechanisms to produce ATP from glucose and fatty acids 
#biol1008question 

### Aerobic metabolism 
- Glucose > glycolysis > pyruvate (happens outside the mitochondria)
- After pyruvate > acetyl coenzyme A, the rest happens inside the mitochondria
- All of the processes happening inside the mitochondrion depends on oxygen!
- Krebs cycle :: produces CO2 and ATP

![[Aerobic metabolism.png]]

### Anaerobic metabolism
- The pyruvate makes lactate which is released and circulates to other tissues to be used there. (liver or heart)
- Cells can shut down their mitochondria even when oxygen is available =  cancer cells.
- Glycolysis is much quicker for producing ATP than mitochondrion ways. Need quick ATP? Glycolysis

Compare and contrast the tole of glucose and fatty acids as substrates for ATP production 
#biol1008question 

### How much ATP from nutrients?

There is more energy available per gram of fatty acids than per gram of glucose (106 ATP vs  32 ATP/ why humans and animals store energy as fat)
- Aerobic metabolism (using O2 of glucose) produces much more energy than anaerobic metabolism (without using O2/ 32 ATP vs 2 ATP)
- Fatty acids are not used to produce ATP in the absence of O2

### Summary
- Not all parts of your body use energy at the same rate (per gram heart/kidney and then the brain)
- Glucose and fatty acids provide energy for many tissues
- Some tissues in your body don’t need/want glucose, others require glucose
- Our body produces energy by burning glucose and fatty acids
- The energy molecule is Adenosine Triphosphate

Describe the role of ATP as the common intracellular energy for human cells
#biol1008question 

### ATP

Terminal phosphate bonds is "high-energy"
ATP -> ADP + P + energy (~50 kJ)
Converts to ADP when is loses its phosphate when converting into energy = ADP

![[ADP.png]]

How do we measure the amount of a chemical compound like ATP
- We measure the number of molecules 
- Standard measure is a mole (6 x 1023 molecules)
- 1 µmol/l solution of ATP has 6 x 1017 ATP molecules per litre of solution

### ATP in cells
ATP is the energy source for >95% of cellular activity

- Contractility & motility (actin and myosin in muscles)
- Ion pumping
- Signalling
- Biosynthesis…

### Heart
- uses 0.135 µmol ATP per second = 8 x 1016 molecules per second , ~ 6 kg per day.
- contains 1.35 mmol ATP (~ 0.7 g ATP)
- Runs out of ATP within 10 seconds if ATP production is inhibited 

Heart only uses oxygen dependent ATP production.

In the event of a heart attack muscle don’t get oxygen coz blood supply stops

### Replenishing ATP
Systems that prevent ATP from running out.

• From high energy molecules
• E.g. from ADP (ADP + ADP >ATP +….
• e.g. from creatine phosphate

From metabolism of nutrients
?
- Glucose
- Fatty acids
- Lactate
- Ketone bodies

Describe the difference in preferences for metabolic substrates between skeletal muscle, heart muscle and brain and the implications for these starvation
#biol1008question 

![[Tissue - Metabolic substrate.png]]

### Starvation
Body looks really thin as they breaking down skeletal muscle to provide glucose for the brain

![[Energy stores 70kg person.png]]

What do we mean by:

glycogen ::  Polymer of glucose used to store glucose, found in liver and muscle 

triglycerides :: Way of storing fatty acids

Proteins :: Polymer of ammino acids

Mobilizable proteins :: Protein that can be broken down if our starving (skeletal muscle)

### From fed to fasting to staving
First 4 hours after a meal
- All tissues use glucose from the meal
From 4 to 30 hours
- Tissues other than the brain reduce glucose usage 
- Liver produces glucose from 
	- Glycogen
	- Amino acids

### After 30 hours
What happens after 30 hours of fasting 
?
- Brain starts using ketone bodies rather than glucose 
- Other tissues stop using glucose 
- Liver makes ketone bodies from fatty acids  (Acetyl Coenzyme) 
- Liver and kidney make glucose from ammino acids
