Trace a red blood cell arriving at the right atrium through the heart, listing each chamber and structure that it passes on its way to the aorta
#biol1008question 

Blood is ejected out the pulmonary artery. Blood flows through the lugs and becomes oxygenated.

Blood then travels into the left side into the heart through the pulmonary vein.

Systemic circulation (rest of the body): Then the blood is ejected out of the aorta into the body.

After the blood is utilised by the organs and the oxygen is used up, the deoxygenated blood return to the heart> lungs

List the key difference between the three main types of blood vessels

![[Blood vessel differences.png]]
Different types of blood vessels
?
- Arteries are the "pressure reservoir"
- Arterioles direct blood distribution and create high resistance
- Capillaries allow exchange with tissue
- Veins are the "volume reservoir"

Blood vessel similarities 
?
- All have a layer of endothelium 

Explain why blood flows continuously around the body 
#biol1008question 

The heart:
“Workhorse” of the body

- Generates a pressure to force blood continuously around the body
- Composed predominantly of cardiac muscle
- 4 chambers: right atrium, left atrium, left ventricle, right ventricle
- Blood lows unidirectional due to valves.
- The valves closes when the pressure inside the heart rises.
- Atrioventricular valve= closes when the pressure inside the blood rises.
- Semilunar valve.
- Tricuspid: right side, 3 tissues.
- Bicuspid valve: left side, only 2 tissues
- The left side has a very thick muscular wall= because the muscle on the left side has to contract harder because it drives the blood to the rest of the body.
- Heart pumps from bottom up.

![[Heart.png]]
Specialised cells within the heart generate an electrical signal to coordinate contraction:

### Autophytic cell (pace-maker cells)
- Depolarises the membrane, spreading rapidly through conducting pathway
- The electrical activity must trigger the muscle to contract.
- Atria contracts first> the bottom ventricles> drives blood out.
- alters movement of charge across membrane (depolarises membrane) travels down through atrium.

Electrical activity must proceed the mechanical movements of the heart. So the electrical activity stimulates hearts movements

Explain physiologically why you can feel a pulse when pressing your fingers to an artery
#biol1008question 

pulse (driving blood pressure):
- When the heart pumps, blood is ejected into the blood vessels, it creates a driving blood pressure and that’s what is the pulse.
- Our heart cycles between contraction and relaxation in a rhythmic fashion
- Mediated by the rate of generation of action potentials in the sinoatrial node
- Our pulse indicates how often our heart is beating
- Averages ~60 -100 bpm, but is highly variable

![[Driving blood pressure.png]]

Pressure:
- Pressure is defined as a force that is exerted against
- A container
- Blood against the blood vessels and the resistance to flow
- Why is blood pressure important?
- Blood must be able to flow from the heart all the way around the body and back to the heart again
- How does it achieve this?
- Blood (fluid) flows from an area of high to low pressure
- Arterial system is under high pressure, venous system is under low pressure.
- The friction of the blood vessels slows down the blood flow (drops blood pressure)

![[Blood vein pressure.png]]

Describe why fluid is lost from the blood to the interstitium when exchange takes place at the capillaries?

At the arterial end of the capillary, (where blood flows into the capillary from an artery), the pressure of the blood forces fluid out of the vessel into the interstitial space, although a smaller amount of fluid moves from the interstitial space back into the capillary via osmosis. At the venous and of the capillary, (where blood flows out of the capillary into a vein), these flows are reversed, with lots of fluid moving from the interstitial space into the capillary due to osmosis, and relatively little leaving the capillary due to blood pressure
